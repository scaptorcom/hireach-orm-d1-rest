# D1 ORM Examples

This folder contains practical examples demonstrating how to use D1 ORM in real-world scenarios.

## üìÅ Examples

### 1. `simple-orm-example.ts`

**Basic Usage Example**

Shows the fundamentals of D1 ORM:

- Model definition with basic field types
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Simple queries and filtering
- Basic validation
- Lifecycle hooks

**Run:**

```bash
npm run example:simple
```

### 2. `advanced-models.ts`

**Complex Models Example**

Demonstrates advanced model features:

- Complex field validation
- Custom validators
- Enums and constraints
- Soft deletes
- Timestamps
- Advanced hooks

**Run:**

```bash
npm run example:advanced
```

### 3. `relationships-example.ts`

**Relationships and Complex Queries**

Shows how to work with related data:

- Foreign key relationships
- Complex JOIN queries
- Query builder usage
- Data aggregation
- Comment threading
- Pagination with relationships

**Run:**

```bash
npm run example:relationships
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up your environment:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Cloudflare D1 credentials
   ```

3. **Run any example:**

   ```bash
   # Simple example
   npm run example:simple

   # Advanced models
   npm run example:advanced

   # Relationships
   npm run example:relationships
   ```

## üîß Configuration

Each example uses the `createDatabaseService()` function to connect to your D1 database. Make sure you have:

1. **Cloudflare D1 Database** set up
2. **Environment variables** configured:
   ```env
   CLOUDFLARE_D1_TOKEN=your_token_here
   CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
   CLOUDFLARE_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id
   CLOUDFLARE_DATABASE_NAME=your_database_name
   ```
